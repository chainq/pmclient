# What is this?
This is a rudimentary PartyMeister client app, which was created to
support/streamline some of the compo organizer stuff I do at Revision
parties, like filtering irrelevant information for better overview,
ease the downloading of entries at the Amiga compomachine, batch
entry downloads, etc.

It contains (or rather, will contain, if I stop slacking) things I need,
but you're welcome to add things you need.

Please note that this is not designed to interact with PartyMeister as
a party visitor, but as a party organizer, and might need special setup
on the PM server side. In other words: it's probably completely useless
to you.

It's released under the Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License v2
as published by Sam Hocevar.

# FAQ
### What is PartyMeister?
See http://partymeister.org

### What is Revision?
See http://revision-party.org

### What do I need to compile?
You need Free Pascal Compiler 3.0 or later, from http://freepascal.org

### Why Pascal?
Because I ported the recent Free Pascal to Amiga, and I wanted to use
it for something. Also it made things incredibly portable. The code
committed here compiles and works w/o modifications and huge external
dependencies a dozen different systems at least, w/o the need to write
any platform dependent code (except the console coloring code diffs),
just using Free Pascal's bundled packages.

### Really?
Yes.

### Where I can find binaries to download?
LOL. Compile it yourself.

### Why WTFPL?
Because I do what the fuck I want to, and I give you the possibility
to do what the fuck you want to.
